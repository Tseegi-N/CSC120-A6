- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

By having inheritance, the code is more organized, easy-to-write, easy-to-read, and efficient. Just like my expectation, the assignment was much easier than previous ones because the main parent class was already given and ready to use. Contrary to my previous assignments, I didn't face any problems or challenges. I think the main know-how of the assignment is to familiarize yourself with the parent class if you want to write the child classes.
